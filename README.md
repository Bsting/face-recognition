## Project Title: Attendance System with AI Face Recognition

## Problem Statement
Traditional attendance tracking methods, such as manual roll calls or ID card scanning, are time-consuming, error-prone, and susceptible to manipulation (proxy attendance). With the increase in automation and digital transformation across educational institutions and workplaces, there is a need for a more secure, efficient, and contactless method of tracking attendance.
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly system that can:
- Detect and recognize faces from a live camera feed.
- Match detected faces against a pre-registered database.
- Automatically mark attendance with time and date stamps.
- Handle challenges like varied lighting conditions, facial expressions, and slight occlusions (glasses, masks).

## Challenges
- <b>Face Detection Accuracy</b>: Accurately detecting faces in different environments with varied backgrounds, lighting, and angles.
- <b>Recognition Across Variations</b>: Different facial expressions (smiling, neutral, yawning), partial occlusions (hats, glasses, masks), and aging effects over time.
- <b>Real-Time Processing</b>: Ensuring the system can detect and recognize faces quickly enough for smooth user experience.
- <b>Handling Edge Cases</b>: Recognizing twins, handling partially visible faces, and distinguishing between similar-looking individuals.

## Approach
Facial recognition technology, powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offers a promising solution by automatically identifying individuals based on facial features with high accuracy. This project aims to develop an automated attendance system that leverages real-time face recognition to record the presence of individuals reliably, securely, and efficiently, minimizing human intervention and ensuring data integrity.
